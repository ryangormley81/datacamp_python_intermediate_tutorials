# f18 final remarks:
Our code in the master branch works. Right now it is using static information in our JSON file turned into Java objects and dislayed on our events.ftl page. we added to the JSON file manually. To improve this we were working on the Scraping branch. Pconrad helped us with this branch and it is very close to working. The Xpath's are wrong, but after finding the correct Xpath an array will successfully be populated with those elements.

possible features: submit events page, filtering what is displayed. displaying the events in a better way. Embedding a google calenddar and adding events to that.
